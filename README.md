# Registration-Form

This project was developed as part of the internship application for Bharat Intern. The Registration Form is a web application built using HTML5, CSS, and Node.js with MongoDB as the database. The form provides a simple and user-friendly interface for users to register with the necessary information. The front-end design incorporates modern styling with a navy blue background, clear labels, and larger input fields. The project aims to demonstrate fundamental web development skills and showcases proficiency in creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own web development projects.
